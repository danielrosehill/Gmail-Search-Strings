# Model prompt for LLM assisted generation

Along with hundreds of other great use cases, I find large language models extremely helpful for generating things like search filters and Google advanced searches, which are otherwise time consuming and painful to write by hand. 

This is an example of a prompt you can use for this purpose, and it can be easily adapted:

*"I would like to create a Gmail search string in order to find emails that likely contain receipts or refunds. Generate the search string using Gmail compliant syntax"*

An example is probably not necessary, but it never hurts to add one. So you could add an example of a compliance search string such as 1 of these after to explain what structure you'd like. 

If you're using another email provider, then this methodology should work too and can just be adapted
